								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you suffering from sweltering summer heat, here’s a suggestion for a cooling drink, lavender-infused lemonade! Both lemons and lavender grow in abundance here (in California, and my backyard), so it was just a matter of time before they became acquainted.</p>
<p>Lavender is edible, though English lavender and Provence lavender are most often used for culinary purposes. Here’s the tip with lavender: it doesn’t take much. Use it sparingly, like rosemary (which would also be terrific in lemonade by the way).</p>
<p>Too much and your lemonade may taste like expensive soap. But just a little? Lovely.</p>
<p>Many thanks to my friend Kori Farrell who introduced me to this lavender lemonade!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Morenike Fajana, a public interest tenant lawyer, each workday can be different. Her daily schedule — appearing in court, meeting with clients, working in the office or going to see someone’s home — dictates what she wears. But no matter what, Morenike strives to look professional. “I already look young,” she says. “I’ve had clients ask if I was an intern. I don’t want them to be like, ‘Who is this person that I am trusting with my housing situation and my life?&#8217;” Ahead, she shows us five go-to outfits, including a fun weekend look…</p>
<p>“I studied abroad in London, which really influenced my style. There’s a culture of being a little more dressed up there that I found endearing; people seem to take clothes and fashion more seriously. The general look is very ‘smart,’ as they say in the U.K. — understated but chic. It’s also where I discovered <a href="http://bit.ly/2l9qzCr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topshop</a>. One day, on a whim, I checked out the men’s section, and they had really great blazers and sweaters. I found this jacket there, too. The key to wearing men’s clothing is to make all your other clothes form-fitting, so you’re not swimming in your outfit.</p>
<p>“My role is to represent tenants in Brooklyn Housing Court. (For example, I defend tenants in eviction cases and investigate landlords who may not be following the law.) When I go to court, I don’t like wearing a suit; it feels dowdy. So, as a way around it, I’ll wear a sheath dress with a blazer, and so do most of my female colleagues. A blazer is the key to making anything — even a sweater and leggings — look professional. The male lawyers wear suits, but change into khakis and button-ups when they get back to the office. It goes along with our work ethos. Because we’re a public interest non-profit representing low-income New Yorkers, we want to make sure our clients feel comfortable when they come in, not like we’re better than them or something.”</p>
