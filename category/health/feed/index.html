<p><strong>Crunchy Chicken Salad<br />
by Giulia Doyle of <a href="http://www.audrey74.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey’s</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s that time of the year again when we want to shed our jackets and indulge in fresh salads. While I enjoy a classic Caesar, or a good romaine with buttermilk dressing, I also like to make salads that are not found on everyday menus. And if the dressing calls for coconut milk, then I’m even more inclined to try it. This is a delicious salad — the dressing adds brightness and the chicken and nuts provide you with some filling protein. This salad also keeps really well, so feel free to make it ahead for a potluck or Sunday lunch. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe: Crunchy Chicken Salad</strong><br />
Serves 4</p>
<p>You’ll need:</p>
<p>3 cups shredded Chinese cabbage<br />
3 cups shredded red cabbage<br />
1 cup shredded carrots (lengthwise to get soft curls)<br />
1 cup unsalted cashews<br />
1/4 cup chopped chives (try cutting with scissors)<br />
1 cup roughly chopped mint leaves<br />
1 cup torn cilantro leaves<br />
4 small red thai chilies, seeds removed and finely sliced (optional if you don’t like spice)<br />
4 fully cooked chicken breasts, cut into slices</p>
<p>For the coconut lime dressing:</p>
<p>1 cup of coconut milk<br />
2 tbsp of fish sauce<br />
4 tbsp of lime juice<br />
2 tbsp of coconut sugar</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine cabbage, carrot, cashews, chives, mint, cilantro and chicken in a large bowl and toss gently to combine.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a measuring cup, combine coconut milk, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar. Stir well to combine. Pour half the dressing over the salad and gently toss. Divide between plates and top with chilies. Add more dressing to taste.</p>
<p>I like to make a lot of dressing and keep some in fridge to dip veggies in or pour over rice, but you can half the dressing recipe if you want to. Beware of the chilies, as they are very spicy. After slicing them, wash your hands very well and don’t touch your eyes or nose. If you prefer a little less spice, sprinkle the finished salad with dried chili flakes instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago, I ran a vegetarian restaurant in Bloomington, Indiana. One of our Indian friends and customers gave me this recipe, which I’ve revised over the years. (Thank you, Santosh, wherever you are!)</p>
<p>This is a nice curry for a weeknight since it doesn’t involve too much heavy lifting. There are many versions in India, of course, but this one makes a substantial vegetarian meal.</p>
<p>The official name for this dish is “shahi” cauliflower curry. The word shahi roughly translates as “royal,” and it is indeed a royal dish!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-348 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-bizi/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="801" srcset="http://bizi.nanothemes.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804.jpg 1170w, http://bizi.nanothemes.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804-300x205.jpg 300w, http://bizi.nanothemes.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804-768x526.jpg 768w, http://bizi.nanothemes.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804-1024x701.jpg 1024w, http://bizi.nanothemes.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toa-heftiba-84804-380x260.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" /></p>
<p>Turmeric is the lead spice in this curry. It’s what gives the curry its sunny yellow color, and is well known for its anti-inflammatory properties. It’s the superfood of spices.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s a good trick for cutting apart the cauliflower, which I learned on the job at my first restaurant near Woodstock, New York. Our friendly neighbor, chef, and mentor taught us to cut a deep cross at the base and then separate the head into quarters. Slice away the core and outer leaves. Then, with a paring knife, cut between the little “branches” to make florets.</p>
<p>Serve this easy vegetarian curry with naan bread, cucumber raita, and a salad, and dinner is done!</p>
